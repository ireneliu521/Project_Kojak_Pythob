# Project_Kojak_Python

The objective of this project is to help Superstore to maximize its sale. Superstore is a global retail company which has average annual sales around 3.2 million and the products it sells can be divided into three categories, technology, furniture, and office supplies. The dataset I obtain contains Superstore’s sales transactions made in 2012 to 2015 and it’s available on Tableau Community Forums.
